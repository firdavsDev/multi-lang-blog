Task main case:
    Regular user should be able to create one instance of a blog-post (article, post) in three languages "uz", "ru", and "en".
Task:
    1. create a POST request where a user should be able to create a single blog-post instance with three languages
    2. create a GET request where I will retrieve a list of blog-posts, and those blog-post instances should be retrieved in English language only by default
    3. I should be able to switch the blog-post instances' language by sending Content-Language in either header or query params
ToDo:
    ! Create a new project, install everything that is required (Django, Rest Framework and so on)
    ! Use two separate models:
        a) to store blog post instances
        b) to store blog post language instances
    ! Filter and annotate the required language instance to blog-post instance in managers
    ! I should be able to search for blog-post in any language:
        - if I enter the query param such as "?search=приключение" (my search param in russian)
        - but my content-language is in any other language but not "ru"
        - the result of my search should be returned in the language of my choice
        - P/s tasavvur qiling-a, agar mening kontent tilim ingliz tilida bo'lsa va men so'rov parametriga ruscha so'z kiritgan bo'lsam natija ingliz tilida qaytarilishi kerak
